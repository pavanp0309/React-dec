STATE: its a js object which holds the Data or information
Data: it can be cart-icon-value ,it can be Likes ,it can be the value color(dark-lightmode),quantity of the Product

ðŸŽ¯state is mutable : we can change the value 
ðŸŽ¯State is local to a component and cannot be accessed by other components ðŸŽ¯unless passed as props.
ðŸŽ¯state makes application interactive(Users can click buttons, input text, or ðŸŽ¯perform actions )

To use state in functional component we use A hook called useState 


HOOKS: are nothing but javascript functions,it used for manging the satate and life-cycle method
Functions starting with use keyword are called Hooks.

Different TYpes Of hooks 

Basic Hooks :
ðŸŽ¯useState : managing the state in function component
ðŸŽ¯useEffect : used for managing the sideEffects (fetching the data ,
running the Timmers,events(scrolling ,cliking the button))
ðŸŽ¯useContext : used for managing the State globally (Data shared for all the Components)
